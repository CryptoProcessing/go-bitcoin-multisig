Bitcoin M-of-N Multisig P2SH implemented in Go
----------------------------------------------

Under development, but tested and working Go implementation of P2SH multisig transaction.

Current master branch will generate a M-of-N P2SH multisig address with create_multisig_address.go, which can be funded with fund_p2sh.go and spent with spend_multisig.go. Keys.go can be used to generate public/private keypairs as needed.

All transactions are native Go raw Bitcoin transactions. There is no need to run bitcoind or another Bitcoin node for use.

Documentation arriving shortly after coming updates to CLI inteface, but feel free to contact at me _ AT_ soroushjp.com if you'd like to use parts of this code immediately.
